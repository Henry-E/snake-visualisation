# Snake visualisation  

Using the existing rldemo from convnet I applied it to a simple clone of snake. It wasn't particularly good at playing snake but it did learn some cool patterns. This is an experiment to use many snake agents with pre-trained networks all on the same board to create interesting visual patterns. 

Snake_visualisation.html is the new part being currently built. There's an older snake_game which is still used in training the agents.
